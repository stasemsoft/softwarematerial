Ja, in het Engels... Als dat een probleem is: laat weten, dan gaan we denken... 


## Some suggestions to spend your time well: 

- Look in canvas. If you have questions: make a note, maybe discuss with people around you, maybe discuss with me. 
- You can always duckduckgo for tutorials: 'Python beginner list tutorial' if you want to have some beginner tutorial on ... (well, I think you understand). Vary on the search parameters. Use a search engine you prefer. Search engines are very important tools nowadays: it helps to invest in knowing how to use them.   
- Choose a tutorial to start with, but don't stay with that one per se: maybe there is another one that serves you better. 
- Help each other. As they say, explaining something to someone else is a very good way to learn! 
- Probably you can think of some useful activities yourself!? 

## How to look at a tutorial? 
- Maybe after just looking at it everything is clear. Then maybe you are ready to do challenges/exercises. 
- If you get a lot of questions when looking: make notes, so you can discuss it with other people. 
- Get hands-on: Try to run the examples yourself. 
- If it's part 4 of a series, maybe go back to pevious episodes. 
- Maybe just watch until  the end of the video first, while concentrating on the story. After that going back for the hands-on. 
- If you have any other suggestions: try it! Let us know what works, please. We want to learn from you! 

Good luck!
